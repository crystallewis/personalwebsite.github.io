         I am currently a second year computer science major at the University of Guyana.<br>
        <br>
        Although Information Technology was my first choice of study, Computer science seem like the better choice advised at the time.<br>
        <br>
        At my second year of completing my study at the university, Iâ€™ve gain knowledge on programming languages such as the Introductory to C programming and python as well as pascal from previous studies. <br> 
        <br>
       My future Work Goal is to become a network and computer hardware technician for a classified organization ;)
